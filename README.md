# Image Segmentation

Image segmentation refers to the class of algorithms that partition the image into different segments or groups of pixels.

In that sense, image thresholding is the simplest kind of image segmentation because it partitions the image into two groups of pixels â€” white for foreground, and black for background.

### The figure below shows different types of segmentation algorithms:

## Types of image segmentation
- Semantic segmentation (the goal is to assign a label (car, building, person, road, sidewalk, sky, trees etc.) to every pixel in the image)
- Instance segmentation (the goal is to identify and separate each individual objects within an image resulting in a output as a mask containing the specific objects instead of bounding box)
- Panotptic segmentation (combination of Semantic segmentation and Instance Segmentation)
